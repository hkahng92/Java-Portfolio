## Security Basics

**What is authentication?**

Authentication means confirming your own identity. **Credential-based authentication** is about validating your credentials like User Name/User ID and password to verify your identity.

**What is authorization?**

Authorization means granting access to the system resources. Authorization occurs after your identity is successfully authenticated by the system.

## Spring Security Concepts

**Users:**

In Spring, **user** refers to the account associated with the person who uses the system, generally identified by unique usernames. The most common way to authenticate a user account is via password.

**Authorities:**

Spring uses the term authorities to describe the roles or groups to which user can belong. Various authorities can be granted to users. Authorities are arbitrary strings that have no inherent meaning. We get to define the authorities for our applications and we get to assign meaning to these authorities as we wish.

**Principal:**

The Principal is an object that represents a logged in user of the system. The Principal includes information such as the user's name and granted authorities.

**User Details Service:**

The User Details Service is the Spring Security component responsible for retrieving information about logged in users. We can create custom User Details Service components to fit whatever user repository our application uses, or use the default implementation if you use a standard user store and access it in a standard way.

**Authentication Manager:**

The Authentication Manager component is responsible for authenticating users in the system. It integrates with whatever user repository our application uses and has the ability to find users by username and find their associated authorities. Spring has some default implementations for common user repositories.

**Security Schema**

Spring Security supplies a standard SQL schema that can be used for user and authority data. This works well for projects that are being built from scratch or that don't already have a user repository. Spring Security makes it easy to incorporate this schema into the Authentication Manager for your application.

**Data Source:**

This provides database connection configuration if you choose to use the Spring Security default SQL schema.

**Password Encoder:**

A Password Encoder encodes incoming passwords before comparing them to the values in the database. The best choice for this if there are no other constraints is the **BCrypt encoder**. The following must be true for encoded passwords to work:
* Passwords must be encoded before being stored in the database.
* Incoming passwords must be encoded before being compared to values in the database.
* Incoming passwords and passwords in the database must be encoded using the same encoder.

**Endpoint Authorization:**
Spring Security applies authorization rules to individual or groups of endpoints (typically referred to as **sercured resources**). This is done by defining which authorities (typically referred to as **roles**) a user must have in order to access a given endpoint. We have the freedom to:
* Leave some endpoints open to everyone.
* Leave some endpoints open to all authenticated users.
* Limit access to some endpoints to only those user who have been granted particular authorities.

**Logout:**

Spring Security supports the ability to log users out of the system. We can define the following:
* The URL to be accessed when requesting to be logged out.
* The URL to which the user should be redirected upon successful logout.
* Cookies we would like to delete.
* Whether or not the HTTP Session should be invalidated on logout.

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

According to OWASP, the definition of Cross Site Request Forgery attacks is: â€œCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated."
* Spring Security has CSRF protection turned on by default. 
* The CSRF protection is configurable so that it is compatible with a wide variety of UI/client technologies.
